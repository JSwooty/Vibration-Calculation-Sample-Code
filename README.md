# Vibration-Calculation-Sample-Code
My lab conducted vibration measurements of a new structure installed to help damp environmental vibrations. This repository is linked in the paper for those who are interested in seeing how the calculations were done in python. The code is provided in the .py file, and each text file is a different set of data. LABPLATEOFF is the data for our measurements done on the aluminum plate with the compressor OFF, LABPLATEON is the data for our measurements done on the aluminum plate with the compressor ON, and PAYLOAD is the data for our measurements on the payload table.
